    <P class="fancy-question">In 140 characters or less, tell us what makes you unique.*</P>
    <P class="fancy-answer">Fox News producer, professional wedding singer, Tech writer & self-proclaimed nerd that graduated Salutatorian @ Baruch College</P>


   
    <P class="fancy-question">Why are you applying to the Flatiron School? *</P>

    <P class="fancy-answer">I am applying to Flatiron because I truly want to become a developer and feel that the Flatiron school can provide the community and support to help me get there. I feel that a good community is arguably just as important as the material that is available. What really struck me when I visited Flatiron for the first time were the people.</p>

    <p class="fancy-answer">I felt super connected and that we all share the same passion but come from different walks of life- and that’s what makes for a striving community and learning experience. I am currently enrolled in the Intro to Front-End course at Flatiron and absolutely love it. I feel that coding is something both technical and creative and that it combines both my professional and personal passions in life.</P>


    
     <P class="fancy-question">Tell us about your professional/educational career to date. What are you up to now and how did you end up there? *</P>

      <P class="fancy-answer">I currently reside in NYC working at the Fox News Channel during the week and as a wedding singer on weekends. </P>

      <P class="fancy-answer">I received my B.A. in philosophy from the Macaulay Honors College at Baruch College, and was awarded Salutatorian for the class of 2013. At Baruch, I was the Elected Representative Senator in the Undergraduate Student Government (USG) and was a senior staff writer for the student newspaper, The Ticker. I also participated in several national competitions with Baruch and won first place in the Ernst & Young: Your Vision, Your World Competition 2011. </P>

      <P class="fancy-answer">Throughout college, I interned at Warner Music Group (WMG) twice and at the Fox News Channel twice. My second internship at Fox was with Fox and Friends – the national morning show hosted at the time by Gretchen Carlson, Brian Kilmeade, and Steve Doocy. When I ended my internship and graduated, I got my first job at Fox News Radio booking and producing. A few weeks in to that I was contacted by Gretchen (who hosted the morning show) and told that she will be hosting her own show in a few months called ‘The Real Story’ with Gretchen Carlson. She offered me a position as her assistant. I became a shared assistant to both Gretchen Carlson and Jon Scott (host of Happening Now) when the show launched. 2 years have passed since I got this job and I am currently producing on their shows, doing research, and am a social media producer handling over 10 verified accounts on a daily basis. My plan was to go to law school after this job.</P>

      <P class="fancy-answer">The real turning point in my life came a little less than a year ago: My boss Gretchen Carlson was coming out with her first book- ‘Getting Real.’ Since this was not a Fox related project, I managed the website throughout the book tour and had to learn how to do some simple HTML5 and CSS3 so I can play around with the content and design through Squarespace. Thanks to this, I started looking in to coding and realized how much I actually like it. </P>

      <P class="fancy-answer">I started looking at online resources and studying after work using resources such as Codeacademy, Treehouse, Skillshare, Udacity, and Codeschool. I enrolled in a 2-day JavaScript workshop at General Assembly and a 3-day workshop at Fullstack academy. I felt like I found my calling. I decided that I want to pursue becoming a developer full-time and started visiting a bunch of different boot camps. When I visited Flatiron, I knew this was the school for me. I started coming to the ‘Student Presents’ events every Tuesday. When I realized that I could not quit my job yet I decided to enroll in the Intro-to-Front-End course on Tuesdays and Thursdays. I hope to be able to take the next step of my career here at the Flatiron School and be able to develop full-time.</p>

      <P class="fancy-answer">I started working as a wedding singer when I was 17 years old and have been performing since I was 4 years old. I come from a family of musicians. My dad is an international singer and sings in 16 languages so I grew up shadowing him- yes, I’m definitely Daddy’s little girl.</P>

      <P class="fancy-answer">My career goal is to become an on-air tech correspondent while working in the tech industry as a developer. I also currently write for the Fox News tech section and work most weekends singing at weddings and emceeing events throughout the tri-state area.</P>
    
      <P class="fancy-question">Describe your background with computer programming. Please be as detailed as possible. Feel free to include links to any applications you've built, courses you've completed, etc...*</P>
      <P class="fancy-answer">I started learning HTML5 & CSS3 when I wanted to put custom code in to the square space site built for my boss’s new book- ‘Getting Real’.<a href="http://www.gretchencarlson.com/"> This is the site. </a> 

      I have been studying JavaScript and some Objective C for the past few months using online resources like Codeacademy, Treehouse, Skillshare, Codeschool, and Udacity. I am currently enrolled in the Intro-to-Front-End course and have been working on a final project. It taught me the fundamentals of front-end web development and professional workflow using Git, HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, jQuery, and responsive design strategies. I absolutely love this course and am learning everyday. Prior to this course I took a 
      <a href="https://generalassemb.ly/education?format=classes-workshops">2-day Javascript workshop at General Assembly </a>

      and 

      <a href="http://www.meetup.com/fullstack-javascript/events/222354012/?a=md1_grp&rv=md1&_af=event&_af_eid=222354012" >3-day Javascript workshop at Fullstack academy</a>. 

      I have also been attending meetups like ones from ‘Girls Who Code’ and have met amazing people in the past few months, among them are many current and former students at the Flatiron school.</P>


      <P class="fancy-question">The ability to think in a structured way, both creatively and quantitatively, to solve complex problems is an important element of being a successful developer. Can you tell us anything that demonstrates your abilities in that realm? (anything from standardized test scores to experience playing a musical instrument counts)*</P>

      <P class="fancy-answer"> Working in an intense live news environment, I think both quantitatively and creatively in a fast-paced manner on a daily basis. As a daytime producer at Fox News, I am thinking creatively with regard to how I present a story and at the same time I am implementing it in a quantitative way with regard to taking complex ideas and fitting them in to a short time frame. My job requires a lot of prioritization and structured thinking especially during breaking news, where you have to do it all in the fastest and most efficient way possible on live national TV. </P>


      <P class="fancy-question">Is there anything else you'd like us to know?</P>
